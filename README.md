BMICalc
=======

Simple BMI Calculator using wxPython and classes.

This is something I created as part of learning how to build a UI using wxPython and figuring out how to use classes to build a program.

Download both the BMI.py file and the uiDesktop.py file and run the ui file in Python.  Must have wxPython library installed.
